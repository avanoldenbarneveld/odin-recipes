        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>This homemade pasta recipe is consistently great and easy to make with flour, eggs, salt, olive oil, and water. Roll out by hand or use a pasta machine to cut dough into desired pasta shape.</p>

        <p>Why buy the boxed stuff when you can make noodles at home? This homemade pasta recipe is way better than what you can buy at the store — and it’s surprisingly easy to throw together with just five ingredients you likely already have on hand!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

                <li><b>Flour</b>: This homemade pasta recipe starts with two cups of all-purpose flour. </li>
                <li><b>Eggs</b>: Eggs lend fat and moisture to the pasta dough. </li>
                <li><b>Oil</b>: Two tablespoons of olive oil add moisture and help the dough come together. </li>
                <li><b>Salt</b>: A teaspoon of salt takes the flavor up a notch. </li>
                <li><b>Water</b>: Add just enough water to form a smooth, thick dough. </li>
            </ul>
